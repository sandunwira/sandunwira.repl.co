				I'm a boy aged 21 named "Kalpa." I'm a quiet guy around people. I'm a university student and spend my time
				mostly with computers. I live with my younger brother and my father. My father is a very good typewriter, and my
				brother is still going to school. I lost my mother in a car accident when I was 7 years old. My father bought a
				computer when I was 12 years old. I like to make things with computers. The first video game I played with my
				brother was "<a href="https://pacman.com/en/history" title="History (Pac-Man) - [https://pacman.com/en/history]" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pac-Man</a>," and we both enjoyed that game. In university, I decided to do an IT Engineering degree
				program since I love it. I had quite a few friends who looked out for me. Me and my friends exchange everything,
				even clothes.
			</p>
			<p>
				One day, when I was walking towards the IT building, I saw this one girl who seemed to be lost near the
				building. The girl came to me and asked with a gentle voice, "Is this the IT building?" I pointed at the IT
				building and answered, "Yes, that is the IT building. Is this your first day?" The girl smiled and replied,
				"Yes, this is my first day at the university. "Do you have a lecture at 10:00 am?" I said, "Yes, I have a
				lecture at 10:00am. Do you?". "Yes, I have a lecture at 10:00 a.m." the girl politely answered. After that, we
				both attended the lecture. Me and this girl sat in two separate areas since there were no seats available
				nearby. After the lecture, the girl waved to me and left early since there were no lectures afterwards. I had
				some friends from my school at the university, so I stayed at the university for a bit and left home too.
			</p>
			<p>
				I had a crush on the girl I met that day. I couldn't even sleep that day. All I was thinking about was her. She
				had almond-colored skin, blue eyes, and a cute face. She is exactly like the model, <a

				black hair.
			</p>
			<p>
				The next day, when I was talking with my friends near the entrance of the IT building, I saw the girl I met the
				day before walking towards the building. The girl smiled and waved to me, saying, "Hi, good morning!" I'm very
				nervous around girls because I've never had any prior experience interacting with them. I waved back and replied
				nervously, "Good morning!" "I will hold a seat for you, but come quickly, or you might have to sit in a
				different area like yesterday," the girl said. I replied with my shaky voice, "Oh, okay. I'm coming". We sat on
				the same bench next to each other. "What's your name?" she asked. I replied, "My name is Kalpa. What's your
				name?" Then she replied, "My name is Amaya. You can call me Ama if you want." We both talked nonstop before
				starting the lecture and exchanged contact information. We both found new friends that day.
			</p>
			<p>
				After the lecture, Amaya and I left the lecture hall together to explore new areas of the university with our
				new friends. We had fun together. Suddenly, Amaya got a phone call. Her mood changed quickly. Her eyes were full
				of tears. "Sorry, I have to leave now. Bye!" Amaya said and ran immediately. I was so confused by what just
				happened. When I got home, I called Amaya multiple times, but there was no answer. I started worrying about her.
				I called Shalini, Amaya's best friend, and she said that Amaya's father had passed away due to cancer. I
				requested the funeral location from Shalini. I was sad after hearing the news. I informed my father about the
				situation and said that I might stay for a few days there. I got the approval and decided to visit the funeral
				the next day.
			</p>
			<p>
				The next day, I visited Amaya's house. People were gathered in the house. I saw Amaya sitting in a chair and
				decided to talk to her. When Amaya saw me, she started crying more. I started to comfort her, as she was
				helpless at the moment. She said with teary eyes, "Can you stay here until this is over? You're the only one I
				can talk to right now." I couldn't deny that request when she asked me like that, so I said, "Yeah, sure, no
				problem." I stayed at Amaya's house until the burial day. I was trying to talk about more positive topics
				because I wanted to cheer her up. During that time, I was able to learn more about her parents and relatives.
			</p>
			<p>
				After her father's death, Amaya seems depressed and upset. This is not the usual Amaya that I know. So I talked
				to her. She said, "I really miss my father these days," and started crying. "He was like a best friend to me. We
				exchanged everything." It warmed my heart, so I decided to look after her, as there was no one to help her
				during those times.
			</p>
			<p>
				Several weeks later, things were starting to get better. Amaya is not upset anymore as she understands the
				destiny now. She's now motivated and does her work correctly. Since this was the correct time, I decided to make
				my move and ask her. She said YES! as I expected. I was so happy that day. I remember telling everyone I knew on
				campus about us that day. We were holding hands all day. Things were going great until my friend Nimal, woke me up and said, "Kalpa! Kalpa! Bro! The lecturer is coming
				this way. Wake up!".
